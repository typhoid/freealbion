# Welcome #

This project is just getting started but hopes to recreate as much of the original game as possible and allow for bug fixes and expansions.

## Keep Updated ##

The best way to stay informed of updates is to [follow us on Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/freealbion).

We'll be looking to get a forum up and running shortly.

## Help Needed ##

This project is just getting started and it would really help if anybody can contribute.

At the moment assistance is need with decoding the various [File Formats](FileFormats.md). You might be able to determine some information about these (as I have) from the [Producer Mode](ProducerMode.md) that the developers left in the game.
